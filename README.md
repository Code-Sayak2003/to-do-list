<p>In this repository, I have created a react to-do-list allowing task addition, removal, and completion marking, validate task input, display tasks dynamically, and offer optional sorting, filtering, and localStorage integration</p>
<br>
<h2>Testing guidance</h2><br>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository using git clone <repo_url>.</li>
  <li>Open the terminal and run npm install, to install all the dependencies.</li>
  <li>Now run the code on local host using the command: npm run dev</li>
  <li>You can test various features by adding a task, removing a task, for marking complete you can click on the task and it will be strike-through, you can also filter the task by three tags - all, completed and incomplete etc.</li>
</ol>
